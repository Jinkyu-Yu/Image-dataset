# image-dataset
Image dataset for semiconductor images.
We collect 164 defective images from literature.
We divide the 164 defective images into 148 training dataset and 16 validation dataset.
We also use 16 corresponding defect-free images generated by the exemplar-based inpainting method.
We apply the data augmentation strategy such as complement, rotation, and flipping.
Finally, we use the $148\times2\times8=3,368$ defective images.
